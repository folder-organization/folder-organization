# folder-organization

## Description

Folder Organization is a simple yet powerful Rust tool designed to generate and maintain README.md files within your project directories.

This script automates the documentation process by detecting subdirectories in a main folder and updating or creating a README.md file in each folder.

## üöÄ Features

### Subdirectory Discovery

Automatically retrieves the list of subdirectories within a specified folder, respecting `.gitignore` rules. 

### Automatic Documentation Generation

Creates or updates `README.md` files for each directory, adding a detailed section on the organization of subdirectories. 

### Smart Markdown Management

If a `README.md` file already exists, the script looks for a section titled "## Folder organization" and updates it with the latest information. If this section doesn't exist, it is added at the end of the file. 

### Customizable Descriptions

Associates default descriptions with specific folders (`docs`, `src`, `tests`), while allowing custom descriptions for other folders.

## üí° Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Build the project with Cargo:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Run the generated binary, specifying the path to the folder you want to document:

### Linux

```sh
./target/release/folder-organization <your_project_folder>
```

### Windows

```sh
./target/release/folder-organization.exe <your_project_folder>
```
    
The tool will scan the specified folder, list its subdirectories, and update or create a README.md file in each subdirectory, with a dedicated section for folder organization.

## üì¶ Examples

Here's an example of a project structure generated by the tool:

```markdown
[`üìÇ src`](src)
> Source code.

[`üìÇ docs`](docs)
> Documentation.

[`üìÇ tests`](tests)
> Unit tests.
```

Each subdirectory will have its own README.md file with a "Folder organization" section describing the subfolders it contains.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

This project is fully developed in Rust, ensuring optimal performance and safe memory management.
